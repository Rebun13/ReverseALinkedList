# ReverseALinkedList

## Description

Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty. 

## Returns

- SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the reversed list

## Input

The first line contains an integer _t_, the number of test cases.

Each test case has the following format:

- The first line contains an integer_n_, the number of elements in the linked list.
- Each of the next _n_ lines contains an integer, the _data_ values of the elements in the linked list.
